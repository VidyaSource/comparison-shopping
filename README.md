#Vidya Tutorial: Comparison Shopping

##Description

These are the files that accompany the [Vidya](http://www.vidyasource.com) video tutorial 
[Comparison Shopping](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A) on how to use *Comparable* and
*Comparator* to sort collections in Java.


##Intended Audience

This tutorial is for intermediate-level Java developers who want to add comparison and sorting capabilities to the
custom classes theyâ€™ve created for their projects.


##Instructions

Just download the files and view them in your favorite editor. Follow along with the tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A),
or play with the code yourself to try different ideas.

Although not strictly necessary for the focus of this tutorial, you do need Java 7 running on your machine for the code to work
out of the box. If you insist on running with Java 5 or 6, modify the first line of the *main* method in
*ComparisonShopper.java* to replace the diamond with the more verbose [generics](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/)
collection instantiation.

To compile and run the code, you can do any of the following:
* If you have [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) installed, either get your [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
to execute the *gradle* command or do it yourself by navigating to the top-level directory and simply typing "gradle" at
the prompt.
* Import the code into your IDE and run *main()* in *ComparisonShopper*.
* If you are really hardcore, compile and run manually as described by [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/compile-136656.html).
