#Vidya Tutorial: Comparison Shopping

##Description

These are the files that accompany the [Vidya](http://www.vidyasource.com) video tutorial 
[Comparison Shopping](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A) on how to use *Comparable* and
*Comparator* to sort collections in Java.


##Intended Audience

This tutorial is for intermediate-level Java developers who want to add comparison and sorting capabilities to the
custom classes theyâ€™ve created for their projects.


##Instructions

Just download the files and add them to your favorite Java editor. Follow along with the tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)
or play with the code yourself to try different ideas. The project uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) to be editor-agnostic. 
If you want to run the code, either get your editor to execute the *gradle* command or do it yourself by navigating
to the top-level directory and simply typing "gradle" at the prompt.

Although not strictly necessary for the focus of this tutorial, you do need Java 7 running on your machine for the code to work
out of the box. If you insist on running with Java 5 or 6, modify the first line of the *main* method in
*ComparisonShopper.java* to replace the diamond with the more verbose generic collection instantiation.
